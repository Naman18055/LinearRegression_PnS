README for Assignment1

Pre-Requisite Files - ConferenceData.csv and found.txt
Files Produced - ConferenceFinal.csv (Contains Name of the conference, H-Index and Predicted Impact Factor) and Journals.csv (.csv version of found.txt for better view and understanding)

Used the concept of Linear regression. First read the train data and then applied it's results on testing data.

Code Submitted in LinearRegression.py file which is a python3 code, written for cleaning and processing the input data and then calculate and produce the required output such as Mean Squared Error, Correlation and Predicted Impact Factor.
Used python csv module for reading and writing of csv files. 

Note- The training and test data-set are taken at random (assumed that assignment needs to be done in this manner),
so results will come different every time. 
Although the code for non-random distribution is written in comment-out section, which will produce same result every time.

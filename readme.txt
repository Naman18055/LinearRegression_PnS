README for Assignment1

Pre-Requisite Files - ConferenceData.csv and found.txt
Files Produced - ConferenceFinal.csv (Contains Name of the conference, H-Index and Predicted Impact Factor) and Journals.csv (.csv version of found.txt for better view and understanding)

Code Submitted in Assignment1_2018038.py file which is a python 3.7 code, 
written for cleaning and processing the input data and 
then calculate and produce the required output such as Mean Squared Error, Correlation and Predicted Impact Factor.
Have used csv module for reading and writing of csv files. 
Also, I have used a modular approach for the program by making multiple functions such as mean, standard deviation, correlation and covariance.

Note- The training and test data-set are taken at random (assumed that assignment needs to be done in this manner),
so results will come different every time. 
Although the code for non-random distribution is written in comment-out section, which will produce same result every time.
